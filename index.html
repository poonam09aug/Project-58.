 <p id="p">I like to research because it is a very good way to learn information you never knew before. Its a great thing to do while your not busy because you can get to know lots of information instead of doing something like drawing. Reasearching is a thing that can be done by anyone you me or a sibling. With extra knowledge you can show off your great facts to your friends. Need some cool facts? Well researching has got your back.
